    <h1 class="justify">The Advantages of Breaking Your Elbow</h1>

    <p class="justify">
      As you can imagine, there are numerous advantages to breaking any bone, and I really think everyone should at some time in their life. However, I can also understand why you wouldn't want to, so this page will also contain a warning and the few
      disadvantages to breaking yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
      First of all, when you break most bones, you can get out of gym. Now, if you're one of those strange beings which wouldn't enjoy a nice break from physical education, then you deserve to break your neck, not your elbow, so yeah, go ahead and
      don't break your elbow. But for all you normal people, breaking your elbow is a great option because it heals relatively fast, but if you want to you can easily stretch it out for longer by falling on it. Assuming you break your non-dominant
      one, you don't have to stop doing a lot of your other favourite activities for much more than a week. After that, they'll encourage you to move your elbow lots, and therefore tell you to go do all your favourite elbow-moving activities -
      knitting, playing an instrument, whatever you like to do. But anyway, getting out of gym gets back another three or however many hours per week. You can use these to look into your own interests, to finish schoolwork to avoid homework, and to
      generally waste your time less than you do in gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, there are a LOT of things that you can do with the sympathy you'll aquire after breaking a bone. In fact, you can pretty much get anyone to do anything for you when you're immobilized that way. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey can you carry my back pack for me? It's hard, with my arm and all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind buying me a burger? I forgot my money at home, I was in a lot of pain and I got distracted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you write a ten page essay for me? I just feel like it'd be really hard. It's really annoying having a broken elbow."
    </p>
    <p>
      But that's not the only way you can milk that arm of yours - you can get out of schoolwork, chores, hand in assignments late, get extensions, and sit near your friends in school. It's interesting that you actually read this far, that's somewhat
      surprising. I can see you've got determination and you're intelligent, so you don't deserve to go through this. Whatever you do, do not break your elbow or any other bones. It sucks.Everyone will feel so bad for you they'll do anything! In
      order to get these benefits, just explain that it's necessary for your health.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think this assignment is going to be very good for my arm - it's just really hard to move it, and I can't really type one handed, can I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm worried I'll break a dish if I can't use both hands, do you mind if my brother empties the dishwasher instead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, darn! You didn't get that assignment? Let me think... Oh! I was about to share it with before school the morning it was due, but then there was a spike in pain in my arm (looks sadly at arm) and I went to take some painkillers and forgot
      about it. I'm so sorry! Can I hand it in now?"
