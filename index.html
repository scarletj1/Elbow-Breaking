    <h1>How to Break Your Elbow</h1>
    <!--Above: the largest heading

  Below: a paragraph describing the purpose of the document-->
    <p>This handy tutorial will help you get your elbow as utterly obliterated as possible.</p>

    <!--Below is an ordered list. The ol tag begins and ends the list, and the li starts and ends a list item.-->
    <ol>
      <li>Find one trampoline. This is not mandatory, but most people find it helpful.</li>
      <li>Imagine a line going straight through your waist, from left to right. Rotate 180 degrees around this axis.</li>
      <li>Make one of your arms taut. We recommend your non dominant arm, but it is up to you.</li>
      <li>Listen carefully for a crunchy crackle and pop. Bonus points if you dislocate it too.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here are a few more tips to make sure everything goes as planned.</p>
    <!--the hr tag makes a horizontal rule. I don't want one.-->

    <!--ul begins and ends an unordered list-->
    <ul>
      <li>To avoid infection, which could cause death, make sure you have an untrained medical professional in close vicinity to your location.</li>
      <li>A common problem our customers face is that they lose the nerve to go
        through with the plan, even if they know they want it to happen. A good way
        to prevent this from happening is to have a trusted friend (preferably with
        experience in martial arts, but anyone will do) nearby to break it for you.

      <li>What are you still doing here? Go and get to it, already!</li>
